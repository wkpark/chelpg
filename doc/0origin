Folks,	

For computing electrostatic potential-derived charges from ab-initio
wavefunctions generated by one of the Gaussian 86/88/90 packages, the CHELPG
program is helpful.  This program is a rotationally-invariant modification of
the QCPE program CHELP by Chirlian and Francl.  For a description of the CHELPG
program and some results, see:   Breneman, C. and Wiberg, K, J. Comput. Chem.
1990, 11, 361.  The program source code is available for Unix and VMS via
internet mail.

        To all those who requested the CHELPG source code:

It is now on its way to you via Internet mail.  You will need to compile and
link it with the Gaussian utility library, and with the l401 library.
Please contact me if there are difficulties.

	Brent,

Here comes the CHELPG source code.  The following three messages are: 1) the
CHELPG source code in generic Unix fortran77; 2) A sample h2o input file;
3) A sample h2o output file.  The program should work with G88 or G90
in its present form.  Merely compile it, and then link with l401.a and util.a.
You may need to run c8690 on your checkpoint files if they were written with
an early version of G88.  Let me know if I can be of any assitance.
